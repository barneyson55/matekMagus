# Critical TODO / Risks

- Missing app icon (`assets/icon.png`) referenced by the Electron window config; may break packaging or branding.
- CSS encoding issues in `style.css` can cause broken UI glyphs on Windows.
- `assets/temakorok` is not the single source of truth for navigation (risk of drift).
- README notes `modules/linearis_fuggveny.html` test generator is incomplete (verify current behavior).
- Large module backlog remaining from the curriculum roadmap; incomplete coverage can confuse users.
